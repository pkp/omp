# Unsupported Upgrades

OMP does not support direct upgrades from all prior versions. If your copy
is extremely old, you may need to upgrade first to an intermediate version.

## Upgrading from OMP older than 3.1.0

In order to upgrade from older releases of OMP than 3.1.0, you will first need to
upgrade to an intermediate version of OMP between 3.1.0 and 3.3.x (with the
latest 3.3.x recommended). Download an intermediate version of OMP and follow
the upgrade instructions included there, then read the [docs/UPGRADE](UPGRADE)
document included in this package to continue with the upgrade from there.
