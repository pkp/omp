Configuration Changes
---------------------

See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a description and examples of all supported
configuration parameters.

- An allowed_hosts option was added to protect against HOST injection attacks.
  We recommend configuring this setting! See "Recommended Configuration" in
  docs/README.md for details. (https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7649)
- The proxy configuration settings have changed. Please review the [proxy]
  section in config.TEMPLATE.inc.php and adapt your settings in config.inc.php
  as needed.
- The db.persistent option for persistent database connections has been removed.
- The db.collation option for configuring a database connection collation has
  been added (default: utf8_general_ci)
- New config.inc.php parameters added for OAuth-based SMTP authorization:
  (see https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Using-Gmail-with-XOAUTH2)
  - email.smtp_authtype: See PHPMailer's AuthType setting
  - email.smtp_oauth_provider
  - email.smtp_oauth_email
  - email.smtp_oauth_clientid
  - email.smtp_oauth_clientsecret
  - email.smtp_oauth_refreshtoken
- The setting general.session_samesite (default value: Lax) has been added to control the "SameSite" setting for the session cookie.
