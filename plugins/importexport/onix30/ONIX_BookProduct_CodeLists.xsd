					<xs:documentation>The product is no longer available from the current publisher, under the current ISBN, at the current price. It may be available to be traded through another channel. A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ usually but not always means that the publisher has decided to sell off excess inventory of the book. Copies of books that are remaindered are often made available in the supply chain at a reduced price. However, such remainders are often sold under a product identifier that differs from the ISBN on the full-priced copy of the book. A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ on a given product record may or may not be followed by a Publishing Status code 06 ‘Out of Stock Indefinitely’ or 07 ‘Out of Print’: the practise varies from one publisher to another. Some publishers may revert to a Publishing Status code 04 ‘Active’ if a desired inventory level on the product in question has subsequently been reached. No change in rights should ever be inferred from this (or any other) Publishing Status code value</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>ONIX local code, distinct and exclusively spoken variation of Spanish, not distinguished from spa (Spanish, Castilian) by ISO 639-3. Neutral Latin American Spanish should be considered a ‘shorthand’ for spa plus a ‘country code’ for Latin America – but prefer spa plus the relevant country code for specifically Mexican Spanish, Argentine (Rioplatense) Spanish, Puerto Rican Spanish etc. Neutral Latin American Spanish must only be used with audio material (including the audio tracks of TV, video and film) to indicate use of accent, vocabulary and construction suitable for broad use across Latin America. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>EUDR raw material location (interior or full product)</xs:documentation>
					<xs:documentation>For EU Deforestation Regulations, location of raw material source plot (‘where the tree grew’) for the interior or main body of the product (or for the entire product, if the raw material source for the binding and other parts of the product cannot be differentiated). If there are multiple sources for the same raw material, repeat &lt;ProductFormFeature&gt; for each plot. Further repeats of &lt;ProductFormFeature&gt; may be used for multiple paper, card and board types. &lt;ProductFormFeatureValue&gt; is a country code from List 91 indicating the country in which the source plot is, optionally followed by space and a date of harvest of the source plot (YYYY, YYYYMM or YYYYMMDD). &lt;ProductFormFeatureDescription&gt; is a list of points defining the plot from which the raw material was harvested, using GPS coordinates with 6 decimal places of precision (these are real numbers, ±90 for latitude [negative numbers indicate a latitude south of the equator], ±180 excluding -180 itself for longitude [negative numbers indicate a longitude west of the Prime Greenwich meridian]). Latitude and Longitude for each point are space-separated, and multiple points are comma-separated. (Note these coordinates use decimal parts of a degree, not minutes and seconds.) ONE point defines the centre of a 4 hectare plot (200m × 200m). TWO points define a line joining opposite corners of a ‘square’ plot bounded by two lines of latitude and two of longitude. THREE or more points define a simple polygon outlining the plot. Lines and polygon edges may not cross a national boundary or the 180° line of longitude. Polygon edges may not intersect. It is good practice to ensure the polygon is drawn clockwise and is ‘closed’ (that is, that the first and last points are identical, so that for example four points define a triangle). If not closed, the closing polygon edge is implied, and to avoid ambiguity, trailing zeros in the latitude and longitude should be explicit. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>All non-decorative content supports reading without sight</xs:documentation>
					<xs:documentation>Sometimes termed ‘screen reader-friendly’, and fully supports multiple forms of non-visual reading. All contents of the digital publication necessary to use and understanding, including text, images (via their alternative descriptions), audio and video material (via their transcripts, descriptions, captions or subtitles) are fully accessible via suitable reading devices, for example text-to-speech screen readers or tactile reading devices (‘Braille displays’), and nothing in the digital publication prevents or blocks the use of alternative reading modes. The entire publication can be navigated and ‘read’ using only text rendered via sound or touch, and does not require visual perception. NB this implies that all &lt;ProductContent&gt; types listed can be accessed without sight. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later</xs:documentation>
