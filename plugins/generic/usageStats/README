About
-----
This plugin implements usage statistics logging and processing, and also 
default reports to retrieve statistics related to the press, monographs
and monograph files.

Usually an usage statistic event is a page view (press catalog index page,
abstract monograp page, etc) or a file download (monograph file downloads).

This plugin can also log statistics aggregated by the geo location of the
user. To activate this option, take a look at the INSTALLATION section of
this document.


System Requirements
-------------------
The default usage of this plugin is automatic and doesn't require any other
extra requirement other than OJS already does.

If you want to learn on how to process external log files, like apache access
files, please refer to https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=PKP_Statistics_Framework#External_access_log_files_alternative


Installation
------------
There is no extra step to install this plugin, other than running the OJS
installation. It is activated by default.

The only needed additional step depends on whether you want to have geo 
location data in your statistics or not. If that's the case, follow these
steps:

Linux:
1 - open a shell prompt
2 - go into OMP installationâ€™s base directory
2 - wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
3 - gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
4 - mv GeoLiteCity.dat lib/pkp/plugins/generic/usageStats

Windows
1 - download the file http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
2 - decompress it using any decompression tool into lib/pkp/plugins/generic/usageStats directory

In both cases the complete path to the installed database file should be
lib/pkp/plugins/generic/usageStats/GeoLiteCity.dat
